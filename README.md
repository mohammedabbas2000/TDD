# TDD - exercise for Testing and quality in software engineering course

You must build a program that ran on a certain topic such as: game, service provision, etc. (you decide on the topic - required).
A brief description of what the program does (
Has 4 functions (the functions must be full of "meat" and not functions like set(), get) in the JAVA language.
(Please attach a short description before each function, what it does)
When you are required to realize 2 functions from the program using the TDD development method.
(that is, a total of 2 functions that are implemented in advance, and another 2 functions that are implemented using the TDD method)
Guidelines:
• The development of the system will be in the TDD method - you are required to perform a full TDD process that includes refactoring.
• For each function you implemented, you are required to save each version of the method as a comment and leave it available only
the latest function in its latest version. The goal is to allow you to show your development method
In TDD.
• How to submit:
zip file>.ID2>_<ID1 <which includes the following files:
o The program before developing 2 functions in the TDD method named ____beforeTDD and the name of the program.
o src directory with development of the software
o The test directory with the necessary tests
o The program after developing 2 functions using the TDD method called ____afterTDD and the name of the program
